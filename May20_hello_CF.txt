Hey April!
My name is Caitlin Friesen. I’m a first year grad student in Molly Cummings’ lab. I work on mate choice in fish and explore how different environments might affect interactions between individuals. I’m hoping to become python savvy so I can analyze data and much more. 
Thanks for all your help.
